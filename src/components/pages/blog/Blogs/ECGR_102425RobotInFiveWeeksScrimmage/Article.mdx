<p className="Article-body">
This scrimmage had a unique challenge: time. Teams only had 5 weeks to design, build, code, and test their robots. This challenge was exactly why we signed up. For many, especially rookie members, this short timeframe was an opportunity to test and develop problem solving and innovation skills under pressure.

 Teams arrived early in the morning, met in their assigned rooms, and started preparing for their first scrimmage. Each team played in 6 matches with small breaks in between allowing them to recuperate and prepare for the next match.

Before matches, the teams’ drive team would go to their alliance side and collect around a small table. Alliances strategized based off of their robots’ abilities while the rest of the team spectated on a balcony that looks over the field.

During the lunch break, teams 731, 6183, 5795, and 10195 met in the school’s cafeteria and ate pizza. The extra time allowed teams to fix and prepare their robots for their last matches.

While the results were important, the true success of the scrimmage was the experience gained. The event served as more than just a chance to build and test a robot, it also served as a vital opportunity for the rookie members to step in, design, build, code, and drive their robots. Across ECG Robotics, all the FTC teams came out with a better understanding of working under pressure and teamwork. This scrimmage and its results were not the end, it’s just the beginning.
