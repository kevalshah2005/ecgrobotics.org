Throughout the event, the Night Owls delivered a strong and consistent performance in both the autonomous and tele-operated (teleop) phases. A standout moment came during their six-sample autonomous run—a major highlight of the tournament. This achievement was made possible by their innovative use of gamepad input to guide the robot to precise locations, along with camera vision technology that reduced human error by allowing the claw to rotate and align independently.
