On September 6, just before 8:00 am, FTC 731, 5795, 6183, and 10195 went to A&T. Once everybody was admitted, the members split into different rooms to view the opening presentation. During the opening presentation an archaeologist spoke about the importance of archaeology and the need for STEM in archaeology, leading to the reveal of this season's theme: FIRST AGE.

Everybody was shocked! DECODE turned out to be a very interesting game. For the last few years, each robot game has been a pick and place type game, where a robot would intake some piece and place it somewhere else. DECODE is different; it’s a shooter game.

Before long, break time was over and it was back to work. All four FTC teams in ECGR had signed up for the Robot in 5 Weeks (RI5W) Scrimmage—an event held just five weeks after kickoff. With such a tight deadline, teams don’t have the luxury of extended design phases or intricate custom parts. Instead, the scrimmage pushes everyone to move quickly, giving rookie members a chance to gain hands-on experience while helping the teams shift into “game mode” much earlier in the season.
